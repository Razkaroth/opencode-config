# Rules for reference folder management

If the user tells you to explore something in the reference folder you should use bash tools like eza, ls, bat, etc. to interact with the content of this folder.

since the folder is git ignored, most of your tools will fail to interact directly, however, bash tools should succed

IMPORTANT: the reference folder is not part of the project, so you should not directly interact with it.

You can use this folder to clone reference material. But do ask for permission before doing so.
